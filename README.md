### Summary

This project was designed to practice working with state in React. I used an `onChange` on the range inputs to change the state of the hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha values of the color in the box. I learned about how to properly change state by using `setState()` instead of mutating the state directly. I also practiced using string interpolation to change the display of the hsla values dynamically as they change in the state. Finally, I added a "Random Color" button that generates random hsla values.

### Project Goals

- [x] Create an app where the user can change hsla values on range inputs
- [x] Make the colors correspond to a box that displays the current color
- [x] Display the hsla values in text form on the page
- [x] Create a "Random Color" button that generates random hsla values

### Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, React
